# AutonomousClaw
This project was conducted to enhance my ability to take my engineering skills across multiple disiplines like software, mechanical and electrical engineering. I designed and prototyped a claw that could pick objects weighed upto 2 kilograms, made entirely out of waste materials. Highlights:
1. Extensive Mechanical Engineering principles to ensure appropriate load management. 
2. Use of Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor, and a single servo motor. 
3. Cleared 18/20 stress tests. Amongst the highest rated claws by design and programming by professors at University of British Columbia. 
4. One of only 15/300 claws that passed more than 16 tests. 

Attached is a short snippet of my code that I wrote to operate the claw autonomously. A unique feature to my design is that it automatically checks if an object is within the range, grabs the object, and automatically releases it after it is placed.
