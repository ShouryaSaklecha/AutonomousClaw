# AutonomousClaw
This project was a physical design of a claw that could pick objects weighed upto 2 kilograms, made entirely out of waste materials. Highlights:
1. Extensive Mechanical Engineering principles to ensure appropriate load management. 
2. Use of Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor, and a single servo motor. 
3. Cleared 18/20 stress tests. Amongst the highest rated claws by design and programming by professors at University of British Columbia. 
4. One of only 15/300 claws that passed more than 16 tests.
